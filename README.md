# Hypermedia project

##  Technology and design


##  Used tools

For the realization of this site we used the Bootstrap Framework

We implemented a working cart, where you can add devices and SL Services.

The optional form to buy a device and subscribe to SL Services appears when you add something to the cart

The form for general request of info is under assistance page.

Unfortunately PhoneGap doesn't support cookies so the cart doesn't work on the android app.

**The website is hosted [here](http://hypermedia.sytes.net)**
